## Identifying Unauthorized IP Addresses

To identify unauthorized IP addresses accessing your account, follow these steps:

2. **Identify Suspicious Activity**: Look for any IP addresses that you do not recognize or that are accessing your account at unusual times.

3. **Geo-Location Check**: Use an IP lookup service to check the geographical location of the suspicious IP addresses. This can help determine if the access is unauthorized.

4. **Alert Support**: If you identify any unauthorized access, immediately alert our support team at security@example.com with details of the suspicious IP addresses.
